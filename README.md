# Diabetic_Retinopathy
There is a huge disparity of opinions among health professionals in classifying the level of retinopathy associated with their patients. It is very difficult to establish a general opinion of all professionals. It is therefore important to identify a more effective way of classifying this problem. In order to reduce the different opinions of health professionals, it is important to introduce machine knowledge, since it presents a lower probability of "opinion" variation than humans. This makes it possible to improve the treatment of patients. 

## Data:
The dataset is composed of 35000 images, the same represented in size 1024*1024 (resized of original images).
And the main objective of the problem is to correctly classify the retinopathy index associated to each image. The 5 classes are:
  - 0 : No DR
  - 1 : Mild
  - 2 : Moderate
  - 3 : Severe
  - 4 : Proliferative DR

## Objectives:
  - Problem understanding;
  - Pre-Analysis of data;
  - Creation of several CNN Models (AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet);
  - Application of various techniques to deal with the main constraints of the dataset (e.g. imbalaced classes);
  - Application of PSO optimization tecnique, in order to optimize results and minimize complexity of models;
