# Colorectal_Histopathology
The Dataset consists of a series of histological images of colorectal cancer.
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers. It is important to establish an appropriate tissue classification mechanism associated with this pathology. The presence of several classes helps to improve the treatment of patients, since most datasets separate only between disease/non-disease.

## Data:
The dataset is composed of 5000 RGB samples, with dimensions 150*150 (height and width). And the main objective of the problem is to correctly classify the tissue type of colorectal cancer. The 8 classes are:
  - Tumor;
  - Stroma;
  - Complex;
  - Lympho;
  - Debris;
  - Mucosa;
  - Adipose;
  - Empty;

## Objectives:
  - Problem understanding;
  - Pre-Analysis of data;
  - Creation of several CNN Models (AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet);
  - Application of various techniques to deal with the main constraints of the dataset (e.g. imbalaced classes);
  - Application of PSO optimization tecnique, in order to optimize results and minimize complexity of models;
